# Stimula2

Based on [GPGPU Curl-noise + DOF](https://codesandbox.io/s/zgsyn) by Paul Henschel

## Tutorials

- [FBO particles](https://barradeau.com/blog/?p=621)

## Future considerations

- [ ] Add a 16k fft to a 128\*128 texture for use in the shader
- [ ] Scatter particles on source geometry and use as emmitters/attractors for particle
- [ ] Skin the audio player using [react-audio-player](https://github.com/justinmc/react-audio-player#readme) or [react-h5-audio-player](https://github.com/lhz516/react-h5-audio-player)
